# Rust Programming – Introduction (Part 1)

## Course Length
2 Days

## Objectives
Rust is an intriguing language. Syntactically similar to C++, it offers higher-order language features to simplify important tasks such as memory management, concurrent execution, and safe vs. unsafe execution.

- Creating, building, and running Rust applications
- Organizing Rust code and application structure properly
- Using object-oriented techniques
- Using functional programming techniques

## Prerequisites
Attendees should ideally have some basic previous programming experience with C/C++ or a similar programming language such as Go or Java.

## Audience
This course is for those who want to learn to write Rust programs. It will help you understand what Rust applications look like, how to write Rust applications properly, and how to get the most out of the language and its libraries.
